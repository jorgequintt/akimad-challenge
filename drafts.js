# Overview
    The objective is to create a small React web app with these main objectives:
        * A search input than when submitted queries the GitHub API to search users
        * A list of users from the resulting GitHub API response
        * When clicking on a user in the list, we should see the user information, repositories, and organizations.
        * Deploy the project. (For example using Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any other services
        * Once completed, the completed test should be delivered via a public link to a Git repository and  sent via email to me.

# Materials
    * Create React App
    * GitHub API Docs

# Bonus tasks
    * Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await
    * Adding a spinner when information is loading
    * Deal with errors coming from the API
    * Having a nice UI using a components library (Material UI, Antd, etc.)
